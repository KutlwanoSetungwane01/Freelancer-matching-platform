# **Reflection: Balancing Stakeholder Needs**

## **Challenges Faced**
During the requirements elicitation process, several challenges emerged in balancing the needs of freelancers, employers, and system administrators. Key difficulties included:

1. **Conflicting Priorities**  
   - Freelancers prioritize job availability and fair matching, while employers seek quick hiring processes and cost efficiency. Ensuring both sides benefit required refining the matching algorithm.

2. **System Performance vs. Feature-Rich Experience**  
   - Employers wanted detailed freelancer profiles, but loading too much data at once could slow the platform. To resolve this, we optimized profile data retrieval for efficiency.

3. **Security vs. Ease of Use**  
   - Implementing strict security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, may create a barrier for users who prefer quick access. A balance was found by offering optional enhanced security features.

4. **Scalability Concerns**  
   - As user numbers grow, the platform must handle increased job postings and interactions. Designing a scalable infrastructure was prioritized to prevent future performance bottlenecks.

5. **Stakeholder Expectations**  
   - System admins required monitoring tools, while freelancers and employers focused on usability. A dashboard was included to meet admin needs without compromising the user experience.

## **Lessons Learned**
- **Prioritization is Key**: Addressing core functionality first ensured that critical requirements were met before enhancing additional features.
- **Continuous Feedback Matters**: Regular input from potential users helped refine requirements and resolve conflicts early.
- **Scalability is Essential**: Considering long-term system performance from the start helped prevent rework later.

Balancing stakeholder needs required trade-offs, but through careful planning and Agile methodology, we created a solution that meets core requirements while remaining flexible for future enhancements.
