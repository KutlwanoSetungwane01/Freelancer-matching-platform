## GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation (Assignment 7)
Kanban Board Customization
I customized the Kanban board to better fit the project's workflow:

‘Testing’ Column: Added to track tasks needing quality assurance (QA) testing, separating development from testing stages.

‘Blocked’ Column: Introduced to identify tasks delayed by external factors, helping the team spot bottlenecks.

Task Assignments and Labels: Tasks were categorized with labels like feature, bug, and enhancement for better organization.

Automation Features: The "Automated Kanban" template was used for automatic task movement, ensuring up-to-date task statuses.
