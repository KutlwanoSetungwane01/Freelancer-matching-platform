## GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation (Assignment 7)
Kanban Board Customization
I customized the Kanban board to better fit the project's workflow:

‘Testing’ Column: Added to track tasks needing quality assurance (QA) testing, separating development from testing stages.

‘Blocked’ Column: Introduced to identify tasks delayed by external factors, helping the team spot bottlenecks.

Task Assignments and Labels: Tasks were categorized with labels like feature, bug, and enhancement for better organization.

Automation Features: The "Automated Kanban" template was used for automatic task movement, ensuring up-to-date task statuses.

## Object State Modeling and Activity Workflow Modeling (Assignment 8)

In this assignment, I focused on modeling the dynamic behavior and workflows of the freelancer matching platform. The task involved creating State Transition Diagrams for key objects such as User Accounts and Projects to define their lifecycles, and Activity Diagrams to map out complex processes like user registration and project creation. These diagrams were designed to align with functional requirements and use cases to provide a clear understanding of the system's behavior. Additionally, I reflected on the challenges of designing the state transitions and workflows, balancing detail with clarity.

 ## Object-Oriented Design for a Freelancer Job Matching Platform (Assignment 9)
This assignment focuses on object-oriented design for the Freelancer Job Matching Platform. It includes a domain model outlining system objects and their relationships, a UML class diagram created with Mermaid.js, and a reflection discussing design challenges, choices, and how the system aligns with previous work like user stories and state diagrams.
