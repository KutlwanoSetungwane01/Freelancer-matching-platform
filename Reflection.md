# **Reflection on Use Cases and Test Cases**

## **Challenges Faced**
1. **Aligning Requirements with Use Cases**  
   - Ensuring that every functional requirement from Assignment 4 was covered in use cases was challenging.
   - Some features required breaking down into multiple use cases to capture different user interactions.

2. **Ensuring Test Case Completeness**  
   - Identifying the right number of test cases to validate core system functionality was difficult.
   - Balancing functional and non-functional test cases required prioritization.

3. **Use Case Diagram Complexity**  
   - Representing all user interactions visually without overcrowding the diagram took effort.

## **Lessons Learned**
- **Breaking Down Features Helps**: A single large use case can be broken into multiple smaller ones for clarity.
- **Testing Ensures System Quality**: Well-structured test cases help prevent future issues.
- **Diagrams Are Essential**: They help developers understand system interactions at a glance.
