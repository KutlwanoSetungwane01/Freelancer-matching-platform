Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template


The biggest challenge was customizing the template to suit my specific project requirements. I needed to add custom columns like “Testing” and “Blocked,” which took some trial and error to ensure the board matched the team’s workflow. Additionally, linking tasks and assigning them correctly while keeping the board organized was time-consuming.

Comparison to Other Tools (Trello, Jira, etc.)


Compared to Trello, GitHub offers more advanced automation and integration with code repositories, but lacks the simplicity of Trello’s drag-and-drop interface. Jira, while more feature-rich and suited for large teams, is more complex and costly. GitHub Projects strikes a good balance between simplicity and functionality, with strong integration with GitHub's version control.

Lessons 


I learned that selecting the right tool is crucial for matching the project’s needs. GitHub Projects works well for development teams already using GitHub, while tools like Jira may be more suitable for larger projects. The integration between GitHub's issue tracking and project management features made it an ideal choice for my project.
