## Reflection
Creating the state and activity diagrams came with a few challenges, but it was a good learning experience.

## 1. Granularity of States and Actions
One challenge was finding the right level of detail for the state transitions and workflows. I had to make sure the diagrams were clear and simple, without leaving out important steps. For example, with the "User Account" object, I had to choose which states were necessary, like "Active" and "Suspended," without overcomplicating things.

## 2. Aligning with Agile User Stories
Another challenge was making sure the diagrams matched the tasks from the sprint plan. It was important that each state and action in the diagrams directly related to the features in the user stories. This made the diagrams more practical and relevant to the systemâ€™s development.

## 3. State vs. Activity Diagrams
I also learned the difference between state diagrams and activity diagrams. State diagrams show how objects like "User Accounts" behave and change over time, while activity diagrams are more about the flow of actions, like the "User Registration" process. Both are important but serve different purposes in understanding the system.
