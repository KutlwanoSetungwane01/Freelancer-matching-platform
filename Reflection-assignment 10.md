## Reflection: Assignment 10 

This assignment was one of the most challenging tasks I’ve done so far in the course. It required me to apply creational design patterns to a system I had been building across multiple assignments — the Freelancer Job Matching Platform. 
While I had a general idea of what design patterns are, I found it difficult to fully understand the differences between them at first, especially since each pattern has a specific use case and structure.

I started the assignment by implementing the core system classes based on my class diagram. This part was manageable since it followed directly from my earlier work.
But when it came to applying the creational patterns like Factory Method, Abstract Factory, and Prototype, I had to do a lot of reading, follow examples, and ask for help to understand how they fit into a real-world system. 

Overall, even though I didn’t fully understand every pattern at a deep technical level, I did my best to follow the instructions, implement each requirement, and organize everything properly on GitHub. 
This assignment pushed me to step outside my comfort zone and approach object-oriented programming from a real-world software engineering perspective.
