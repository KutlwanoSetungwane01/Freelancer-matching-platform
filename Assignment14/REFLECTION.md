## What I Did and Learned
The first thing I had to do was add documents like CONTRIBUTING.md, ROADMAP.md, and a LICENSE, which made me realize how important proper documentation is. Writing clear instructions and setting up contribution guidelines helped me put myself in the shoes of a first-time visitor to my repo. I had to ask: “Would I know what to do if I were new here?”

I also labeled issues and created tags like good-first-issue and feature-request, which I had never done before. It helped me understand how maintainers create entry points for newcomers. Creating a roadmap was also interesting — it made me think about the future direction of my project and how features can evolve over time.

## Challenges I Faced
One of the biggest challenges I faced was dealing with GitHub's branch protection rules. I set them up for CI/CD in the last assignment, but that ended up blocking my own pull requests. I struggled to approve or merge my changes, and for a while, I didn’t know how to get around that. Eventually, I realized I needed to either disable the protection temporarily or ask for a peer to approve it.

Another issue was making sure my screenshots and markdown files were added to the right branch — since I didn’t commit them directly to main, they weren’t showing up as expected. Managing branches properly is still something I’m learning, and this assignment helped highlight its importance.

## What I Took Away from This
This task taught me that open-source is not just about sharing code, it’s about making your project accessible and collaborative. Having stars or forks is not just for show, it reflects how well you’ve made your project understandable to others.

More importantly, I learned that clarity, structure, and communication are just as important as the code itself. Whether it's documenting setup instructions or writing helpful issue labels, these small things can make a big difference for someone trying to contribute.

In the future, I’ll definitely approach GitHub projects with a more collaborative mindset — and I now have a better appreciation for the effort that goes into maintaining a healthy open-source repo.
