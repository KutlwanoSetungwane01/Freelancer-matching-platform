# **Reflection: Agile Planning for Freelancer Job Matching Platform**

## **Challenges in Writing User Stories**

- Ensuring stories followed the **INVEST** criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) required refinement.

## **Difficulties in Prioritizing the Backlog**
- Determining "Must-have" vs. "Should-have" features required considering core platform functionality.
- Some lower-priority features (like an admin dashboard) are useful but not essential in the first sprint.
