Kanban Board Definition

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that tracks tasks across different stages of development, such as To Do, In Progress, and Done. It allows teams to manage work effectively, visualize workflow, and improve efficiency.

How the board works

Our Kanban board visualizes workflow by dividing tasks into columns like 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' and 'Testing.' This structure makes it easy to track task status. We limit work-in-progress to three tasks per column, ensuring that the team remains focused and tasks flow smoothly. By regularly moving tasks through the columns, the board supports Agile principles like continuous delivery and adaptability
