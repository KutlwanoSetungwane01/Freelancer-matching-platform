# Reflection – Assignment 12

This assignment was by far one of the most difficult for me. I tried to install FastAPI and run the project through GitHub Codespaces, but I kept getting errors. Even after following all the steps, FastAPI and Uvicorn wouldn't run properly. The terminal gave me errors like "app not found in main" and "file or directory not found."

I tried editing `main.py`, creating new test files, and followed the steps carefully, but it just wasn’t working. Eventually, I decided to continue without running the application because I was stuck for too long.

Because FastAPI didn’t run successfully, I also couldn’t view the Swagger UI on the browser. I did everything else as best as I could, including writing the service layer, API endpoints, and adding tests manually. 

This assignment really challenged me and pushed me out of my comfort zone. It showed me how much I still need to learn about running backend services and setting up APIs in real environments like Codespaces. If I had more time and support, I believe I could get it working.
